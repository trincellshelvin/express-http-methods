# Express HTTP Methods
## Run Server:

In the terminal, type in npm run dev to start the server. In your browser of choice, enter //localhost/3000 for it to run the app on the server as outlined with the port 3000.

## Edit the Routes:

Each app.get (....) is a route to a different page that can be edited to go to the specific page. The Res is the response that the page should receive and pull up in the browser when the page is navigated to. With json type requests only being accessible via thunderclient or the app postman [click here for postman](https://www.postman.com/explore)

To use postman, make sure that you have the desired request option selected from the drop down whether it is Get, Post, Delete, Put, Patch, Head, or Options (see screenshot of listed options).
